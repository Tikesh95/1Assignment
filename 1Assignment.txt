Q-What is a computer?
Ans-A computer is a programmable electronic device that processes data and performs tasks according to a set of instructions called a program. It consists of hardware and software components that work together to execute various functions.

Q.What is RAM?
Ans-RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a type of computer memory that is used to store data and machine code currently being used and processed by a computer. Unlike long-term storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs, RAM is volatile memory, meaning that it loses its contents when the power is turned off.

Q.Where is data stored in a computer?
Ans-Data stored in a computer refers to information that is saved and can be retrieved for later use. There are two main types of data stored in a computer:
    1.primary storage ram
    2.secondary storage(hard drive,ssdetc)

Q.Which is the input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen?
Ans-The input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen is the mouse. A mouse typically has two buttons (left and right) and a scroll wheel. By moving the physical mouse on a flat surface, the cursor on the computer screen moves in a corresponding manner. The left and right buttons on the mouse are used for clicking, while the scroll wheel can be used for scrolling through documents or web pages.

Q.Which language is directly by the computer without a translation program?
Ans-The language directly understood by a computer without translation is known as machine language or binary code. Machine language is the lowest-level programming language that consists of binary code, which is a series of 0s and 1s. Each combination of 0s and 1s represents a specific instruction that the computer's central processing unit (CPU) can execute.

Q.what are input devices?
8.Ans-Input devices are hardware components or peripherals that enable users to interact with a computer or other electronic devices by providing input. These devices allow users to input data, commands, or signals into the computer system. Here are some common examples of input devices:
    1.keyboard
    2.mouse
    3.touchpad
    4.scanner
    5.microphone
